correct: sphere r=1m
C=1.108e-10 F

circular disc r=1m
C=7.005e-11 F

*not sure:
circular coaxial r_in=0.1m, r_out_1=0.5m, r_out_2=0.55m, l=1m
C11=4.33e-11 F, C12 =-3.98e-11 F
C21=-3.98e-11 F, C22=10.55e-11 F

*not sure: parallel_plate w=2m,l=2m,d=0.4m
C11=C22=1.58e-10 F
C12=C21=-1.10e-10 F
however, the Area cap formula is 0.89e-10 F. fringe cap is significant

parallel_box w=2m,l=2m,d=0.4m, thickness 0.01m
C11=1.25e-10 F, C12=-1.03e-10 F (similar to the plates)

parallel_plate w=1m,l=1m,d=0.1m
C11=1.58e-10 F, C12=-1.10e-10 F

*wrong: parallel_plate w=1m, l=1m, d=0.01m (meshsize: 0.1m)
large difference when changing mesh(mesh 0.2m ->0.1m)
C11=-2.499e-10 F, C12=2.689e-10 F (signs are also wrong)

The reason is that: 
0 order basis function v_n(r')=1 if r' in s_n, else =0;
delta testing function w_m(r)=delta(r-r_m).
The inner (s_n) surface integral for G(r_m,r') is approximated by
A_mn=s_n/(4*pi*eps*|r_m-r_n|) if m!=n
A_mn=sqrt(s_n/pi)/(2*eps) if m==n

where r_m and r_n are the center point of the element m and n, respectively.
when the two plate distance d=0.01 < meshzie 0.1 m, r-r' cannot be well appoximated by r_m-r_n. 
Offdiagnal elements are wrong, diagnal may be okay because can still approxiame element to a circle of the same area and do the analytical integration.
BTW, symmetrics may mitigate some integral errors for the offdiagonal element in matrix A.


[todo]
use the same basis and testing functions (Galerkin)
implement higher order basis and testing functions
try numerical integral?

parallel computation:
1) enable openmp
2) domain decomposition

inhomogeneous Green's function?
two objects solves in one matrix, no worries about the homogeneous Greens function. 
But the two objects solves separately, Greens function changes... 

frequency (poisson to helmholz): static, quasi-static, low-frequency, high-frequency
